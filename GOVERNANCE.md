# Project Governance

We offer several templates covering common systems of governance used in some repositories.

See the Contributor Strategy document or more background. Please also review []
as preparation for making governance decisions.

## `GOVERNANCE-maintainer.md`

`GOVERNANCE-maintainer.md` supplies rules for a simple self-selecting council
of Maintainers as project governance.  It assumes that there is no distinction
between the contributors who create the majority of code and documentation for
the project and the group who makes all decisions for the project.  This
governance is suitable for small, very unified projects, and is often a good
starting point for project governance.  It is based on the Jaeger project's
governance.

## `GOVERNANCE-elections.md`

`GOVERNANCE-elections.md` is a template for an elected steering committee,
where senior leadership is elected by the body of contributors.  This is a
suitable structure for larger projects with an established community.  The
template is based on Kubernetes project governance.

## `GOVERNANCE-subprojects.md`

`GOVERNANCE-subprojects.md` is a template for a "project of projects" where
the CNCF project is more of an umbrella for a bunch of closely related
subprojects.  It is based on Konveyor project governance.
